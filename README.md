Run from relentless lightning! ⚡ Escape with friends—or abandon your rivals!

## Core Gameplay

### Weather Waves

    - The storm begins! Seek shelter in the Lightning Rods you've built, or risk getting struck. Without proper preparation, survival is anything but guaranteed.

### Traps
🪤 Turn the battlefield into your advantage! Set up traps to teleport, slow down, or surprise your opponents. Timing and placement are key to catching them off guard!

**Note:** There are 3 types of Traps by **default**.

### Lightning Rods
🛡️ Your best defense against the storm! Craft and place Lightning Rods to protect yourself from deadly lightning strikes. But be warned—these rods have limits and won’t last forever!

**Note**: There are 3 types of Lightning Rods by **default**.

🎲 When struck, Lightning Rods have a chance to trigger one of several random abilities, offering temporary buffs or effects to the player. These abilities can enhance movement, provide defensive boosts, or affect nearby players.

**Note:** Some abilities will activate after the Lightning Wave ends, granting you the effects once the wave concludes.

Each Lightning Rod has visual effects to guide players:
- 🌟 A beam of light extends upwards from the rod, creating a prominent signal visible from afar.
- ⚡ A shimmering boundary surrounds the rod, marking the area where it can provide protection.
